# introspect

This project aims to discover how neural networks&mdash;and specifically LSTMs&mdash;represent knowledge. I believe that this is a relatively unexplored question, yet it could be essential to the future of deep learning. By understanding how neural nets represent knowledge, we may be able to build better architectures or even invent new training algorithms.

# Roadmap

There are really two steps to this project:

  1. Create a tool for inspecting network internals.
  2. Use this tool to analyze various networks.

Currently, task 1 is my focus. I want to begin by creating a web-based tool for inspecting and modifying the parameters of a network.
